# FilestackNodeJSTest
Just a simple app to test two things out: Node.JS and Filestack's JS API's

There are several conditions to this simple program.

- [X] A user may upload up to 5 files
- [X] For all links, they will open in a new tab when clicking the filename or the thumbnail
- [X] For a photo, have the thumbnail open a new tab
- [X] For a document, try to convert it, then have the thumbnail open it in a new tab
- [X] For another type of file, just the filename, which clicking allows us to download
- [X] Have a simple Node.JS server locally serving it
- [ ] Use MongoDB to persist the files that have been uploaded
